# Burn Dissolve Shader (URP)

A simple Burn Dissolve shader created using Shader Graph in Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (URP). This repository also includes a work-in-progress (WIP) version that allows burning to spread dynamically where the user drags with the mouse.

## Features
- **Burn Dissolve Shader**: A basic shader that creates a burn effect, dissolving an object over time.
- **Interactive Burn (WIP)**: A version of the shader that spreads burning dynamically based on user input.
- **URP Compatibility**: Designed specifically for Unity's Universal Render Pipeline.
- **Fully Node-Based**: Created using Unity's Shader Graph for easy modification.

## Roadmap
- âœ… Basic Burn Dissolve Shader
- ðŸš§ Interactive Burn Shader (Work in Progress)
